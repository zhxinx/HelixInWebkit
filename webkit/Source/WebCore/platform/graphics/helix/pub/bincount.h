// This class records a history of binary events, and
// can count the number of TRUE events in the last
// 32 events.
//
// This class can be improved in the following ways
//
// a) Make the size of sliding event window not fixed
//    at a size of 32;
// b) handle the default being set or not set
// c) make the LUT static const so that we only have
//    one copy for all instances of the class
// d) keep a running count of bits by examining the 
//    bits sliding in and out of the window.
