  @header rnsingleton.h
  
  @abstract Macro implementation of a singleton. Ultimately this should 
            probably be included in pnmisc or include. 
 
  @discussion
 	A singleton is a single-instance concept. The singleton macro allows
	a user to declare & define a class without having to make any major
	changes to account for the class being used as a singleton. A user
	also has the possibility of having a class that can be used as a 
	singleton or used as a multi-instance object. It is also possible
	to adapt a pre-existing class into a singleton without modifying
	its definition. <br><br>

	<i>note: the above support is provided because some objects are 
	only singletons within a context. A screen object within one application
	might be restricted to being used as a singleton, but in another
	the concept of multiple screens might be supported. This is the exception,
	not the rule.</i> <br><br>

	The following macros are provided by this header:

	<ul>
	    <li> RN_CREATE_AS_SINGLETON (singleton, implementation); - this macro
	    should be placed at the bottom of the class declaration. It
	    grants access to the classes constructor & destructor. Pass
	    the singleton class name and the implementation name as parameters.
	    <li> RN_DECLARE_SINGLETON (singleton, implementation); - this macro
	    declares the classes necessary to provide the singleton. The first 
	    parameter should be hte name of your singleton class, the second
	    should be the name of the implementation class. This macro would
	    usually be used in the header after the class declaration.
	    <li> RN_IMPLEMENT_SINGLETON (singleton, implementation); - this macro
	    implements the singleton. It is used like the macro above but shold
	    generally be placed in with the class definition.
	</ul>
 
 	Singletons provide two methods of use: 
	<ul>
	    <li> overloaded pointer-to and derferencing operators.
	    <li> static Instance () method:<br>
	    <code>static IMP& Instance ();</code>
	</ul>

	In the authors opinion the first method of use is preferrable. The Instance ()
	method is provided for those who will only be using a method of the singleton
	object once. Below are some sample usages.

    <b>Implementing a Singleton</b>

    <pre><code>
    // blender.h
    class CSingletonOnlyBlender_

	public:
	    void Frappe ();

	private:
	    CSingletonOnlyBlender_ ();
	    ~CSingletonOnlyBlender_ ();

	    RN_CREATE_AS_SINGLETON (HBlender, CSingletonOnlyBlender_);
    };

    RN_DECLARE_SINGLETON (HBlender, CSingletonOnlyBlender_);
    
    // blender.cpp
    CSingletonOnlyBlender_::CSingletonOnlyBlender_ ()
    {
	// code
    }

    CSingletonOnlyBlender_::~CSingletonOnlyBlender_ ()
    {
	// code
    }

    void CSingletonOnlyBlender_::Frappe ()
    {
	// frappe... unfortunately our blender doesn't yet support liquify
    }

    RN_IMPLEMENT_SINGLETON (HBlender, CSingletonOnlyBlender_);
    </code></pre>

    <br><br>
    <b>Using a Singleton as a "Normal" Object</b>
    <pre><code>
    class CChef

	public:
	    void MakeSmoothie () { hBlender->Frappe (); }

	private:
	    HBlender hBlender;
    };

    <b>One-time Use</b>
    <pre><code>
    class CRobber
    {
	public:
	    void TripOverBlender () const
	    {
	       HBlender::Instance ().Frappe ();
