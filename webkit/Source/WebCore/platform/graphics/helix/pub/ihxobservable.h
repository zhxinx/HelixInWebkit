    @singletype IHXObservable
    @abstract Interface to be implemented by services that wish to be observable using 
    the IHXObserverManager architecture.
    @discussion The ObserverManager calls these functions once per registered observer
    when this object is loaded or unloaded.
    
    Aside from setting up this relationship, the ObserverManager makes no assumptions
    or requirements about what notifications might be sent or any other communication
    between the two objects.  Once AddObserver() has been called, it is up to the two
    objects to discover appropriate notification interfaces.  It is also the responsibility
    of the two objects to disconnect and Release() these additional interfaces.
